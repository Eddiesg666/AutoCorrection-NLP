# AutoCorrection-NLP  
## Overview  

Autocorrect is a feature that predicts and corrects misspelled words, simplifying tasks such as writing essays, reports, and articles. Nowadays, many websites and social media platforms implement this function to enhance the user experience on their web applications.  

Using the Python language, we are employing Machine Learning and NLP to develop an autocorrection tool that offers correct spelling suggestions for the provided word.
