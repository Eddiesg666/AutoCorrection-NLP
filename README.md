# AutoCorrection-NLP  
## Overview  

Autocorrect is a feature that predicts and corrects misspelled words, simplifying tasks such as writing essays, reports, and articles. Nowadays, many websites and social media platforms implement this function to enhance the user experience on their web applications.  

Using the Python language, we are employing Machine Learning and NLP to develop an elementary autocorrection tool that offers correct spelling suggestions for the provided word.  

Moving forward, we can develop a more advanced autocorrector system that leverages extensive datasets for enhanced efficiency.  

To improve precision, we might also incorporate transformers and other NLP methodologies such as n-grams and Tf-idf.
